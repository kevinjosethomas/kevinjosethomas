kos-sdk is a Python SDK wrapping K-Scale's Rust-based robot operating system. The SDK provides utilities for hundreds of educators, hobbyists, and inventors to program and interact with America's first open-source humanoids.

The SDK abstracts complex robot control operations into simple, Pythonic interfaces, making it accessible to developers without deep robotics expertise. It includes modules for motor control, sensor reading, vision processing, RL inference, and high-level behavior orchestration.

By providing a clean API layer over the underlying Rust implementation, kos-sdk enables rapid prototyping and experimentation while maintaining the performance benefits of the compiled Rust core.
