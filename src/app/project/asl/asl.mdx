Over the three years I studied ASL at school (my high school was also home to BC's only Deaf school), I developed a deep interest in the language and the potential for computer science to further accessibility everywhere. This project was a short foray into the field of neural sign language translationâ€”culminating into a prototype that enables translation between American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling and English, facilitating communication between ASL signers and individuals who do not understand ASL. You can learn more about my technical work on my [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09311) and open-source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kevinjosethomas/sign-language-processing). For an overview of the project and its impact, you can watch my YouTube demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuPxMWQRoXc).
